### Hi 👋🏽, I'm Tatyana 👩🏽‍💻 

I embarked on my journey into the tech world fueled by curiosity and a passion for solving problems. With a background that's far from traditional, I've navigated the seas of code through self-study and immersive programs like SheCodes and Codecademy. I'm particularly fascinated by the power of data to tell stories and the potential of web development to connect people. Whether it's building travel blog sites for fun and showcasing where I've traveled or crafting applications that improve everyday life, I'm all in. Currently, I'm honing my skills and expanding my knowledge base, aiming to contribute to meaningful projects and collaborate with the community.


### 🛠 My toolbox is filled with: 
- Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Swift, and other technologies.

### 🐶 Non-coding Hobbies 🥾 
When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring the latest tech trends, working on my e-commerce business, or hiking with my husband and rescue pup. I'm on the lookout for opportunities to grow as a software engineer, especially in roles that value creativity, continuous learning, and a diverse perspective.

Feel free to browse my repositories to see what I've been up to! Let's connect if you're interested in collaborating or if you have any projects or ideas you'd like to discuss.
